            <p>After you wake up the next morning, you ask the innkeeper where the stables are.
                 The innkeeper tells you that the stables are behind the inn. You walk out of the inn and walk towards the stables. 
                 You see 3 horses currently not being in use and ask the stable master what the price is for the horse.
                  The stable master replies, “The price is [insert price amount”] What do you do?</p>
