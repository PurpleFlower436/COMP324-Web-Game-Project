            <p>You approach the town square. There are a handful of wanted posters already in eyesight, far too many to tear down.
                You see the inn off to your left, and a market place off to your right.
                 It is late, and some stalls have already begun to close.
                  As your stomach grumbles, you spot a troupe of imperial soldiers hassling the vendors. 
                  You have not eaten in a couple days, but you know it will be risky to go over there.
                   The path to the inn, on the other hand, is clear. What do you do?</p>
